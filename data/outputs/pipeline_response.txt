is simple: create a standard platform applied to any possible IT troubleshooting. \\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd39 Problem identified:\\nToday, when an individual or small business has an IT problem, it is often

everyone,\\n\\nI\\u2019m a final-year CS student working on my major project, but I\\u2019m aiming to build something that could turn into a real startup.\\n\\nI\\u2019m creating a full-stack development platform where you start by describing your idea (like \\u201cbuild a job portal with admin auth and Stripe payments\\u201d), and it generates the frontend + backend structure for you. You can edit the code directly in the browser, see a live preview of both frontend and backend (yes, even Express APIs run inside the browser), and deploy the finished app with one click.

from niche subreddits to Discord communities to newsletter sponsorships.\\n\\nin other words i'm making a comprehensive database of all kinds of places to promote your products. i've already added over 1000 verified locations including:\\n\\n* startup directories with domain ratings and submission requirements\\n* reddit communities sorted by subscriber count and activity level\\n* discord and slack communities with member counts\\n* newsletter sponsorship opportunities with pricing info\\n* places where you can run ads or get featured\\n* specific subreddits that allow startup posts (with posting rules)\\n* facebook groups and linkedin communities\\n* telegram channels and twitter communities\\n\\nwhat makes this different from other lists floating around:\\n\\n* includes domain rating for each directory so you know which ones have SEO value\\n* shows estimated impact level (high/medium/low traffic)\\n* all of them are free to post on\\n* includes direct links to submission pages\\n* constantly updated with new findings\\n* a page that allows you to post YOUR startup for free easily.\\n\\nthe next step is adding more niche from suggestions, communities and automating some of the submission processes to save founders time.\\n\\nyou can access the full database

differently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m not just building another &amp;quot;list of launch platforms and startup directories&amp;quot;. my main goal is to make it way easier to find marketing channels that actually work, from niche subreddits to Discord communities to newsletter sponsorships.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;in other words i&amp;#39;m making a comprehensive database of all kinds of places to promote your products. i&amp;#39;ve already added over 1000 verified locations including:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;startup directories with domain ratings and submission requirements&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;reddit communities sorted by subscriber count and activity level&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;discord and slack communities with member counts&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;newsletter sponsorship opportunities with pricing info&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;places where you can run ads or get featured&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;specific subreddits that allow startup posts (with posting rules)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;facebook groups and linkedin communities&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;telegram channels and twitter communities&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;what makes this different from other lists floating around:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;includes domain rating for each directory so you know which ones have SEO value&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;shows estimated impact level (high/medium/low traffic)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;all of them are free to post on&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;includes direct links to submission pages&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;constantly updated with new findings&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;a page that allows you to post YOUR startup for free easily.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;the next step is adding more niche from suggestions, communities and automating some of the submission processes to save founders time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;you can access the full database here:\\u00a0&lt;a

hoping it saves other founders the research time and helps you find channels you didn&amp;#39;t know existed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;let me know what you think or if there are specific types of promotion channels you&amp;#39;d like me to add.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n                \"likes\": null,\n                \"suggested_sort\": \"confidence\",\n
